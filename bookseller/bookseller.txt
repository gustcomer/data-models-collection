G. NOTE :
G.1 The proposed design can easily be extended to selling things 
other than Books by replacing the BOOKS Table by an 'ITEMS_FOR_SALE' Table.
However, a BOOKS Table will still be useful because many data items are specific
to BOOKS, such as ISBN number, and it's better to avoid a coding scheme which
is designed to provide generality at the expense of ease of understanding.
